**User:**
> what is lunar eclipse


**Assistant:**
> A **lunar eclipse** is an astronomical event that occurs when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, such *as* the Moon passes into the Earth's shadow. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1.  **The Shadow:** Earth casts two shadows:
    *   **Umbra:** The central, darker part of the shadow where direct sunlight is completely blocked. If the Moon enters this, it's a total or partial eclipse.
    *   **Penumbra:** The outer, lighter part of the shadow where only some sunlight is blocked. If the Moon enters this, it's a penumbral eclipse.

2.  **How it Happens:**
    *   The Moon orbits the Earth, and the Earth orbits the Sun.
    *   A lunar eclipse can only occur during a **full moon** (when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun).
    *   For a lunar eclipse to happen, the Sun, Earth, and Moon must be almost in a straight line, with Earth in the middle (Sun -> Earth -> Moon). This alignment is called syzygy.

3.  **Types of Lunar Eclipse:**
    *   **Penumbral Eclipse:** The Moon passes through the Earth's penumbra. The Moon turns dark but the effect is subtle and hard to notice without careful observation.
    *   **Partial Lunar Eclipse:** Only a portion of the Moon enters the Earth's umbra. A dark area appears on the Moon's surface.
    *   **Total Lunar Eclipse:** The entire Moon passes through the Earth's umbra. The Moon is completely darkened. Often, the Moon takes on a reddish hue during totality ("Blood Moon"), caused by some sunlight passing through Earth's atmosphere and being scattered (similar to a sunset).

4.  **Why it Looks Red (Totality):** During totality, some sunlight is refracted (bent) by Earth's atmosphere and passes *around* the planet. Blue light is scattered out of the beam, while red light passes through more easily and falls onto the Moon, giving it a reddish or coppery appearance.

5.  **Duration:** Lunar eclipses can last for over an hour, much longer than solar eclipses, and are visible from anywhere on the night side of Earth.

6.  **Visibility:** Unlike solar eclipses, which are only visible from a small area, a total lunar eclipse is visible from anywhere on Earth where the Moon is above the horizon during the eclipse.

Lunar eclipses are relatively common (occurring several times a year), and they are spectacular events, especially when the Moon turns red during totality.

**User:**
> List the top 5 companies working on the space exploration

**Assistant:**
> Okay, here are 5 major companies currently heavily involved in space exploration, often in partnership with government agencies like NASA or national space agencies:

1.  **SpaceX:** Founded by Elon Musk, SpaceX is one of the most prominent private space companies. It's known for developing reusable rocket technology (Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy), the Starship launch vehicle, the Starlink satellite internet constellation, and Dragon spacecraft for cargo and crew transport to the ISS and beyond.

2.  **Blue Origin:** Founded by Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin focuses on human spaceflight, including suborbital tourism (New Shepard), crewed missions to the ISS (New Glenn rocket), and plans for lunar and potentially Mars exploration (Blue Moon concept).

3.  **Northrop Grumman:** (Formerly ATK, then Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems) This company is crucial for NASA's space logistics, primarily providing the Cygnus spacecraft for cargo delivery and crew rotation to the International Space Station using the Antares and later Angara launch vehicles (or potentially others).

4.  **Virgin Galactic:** Founded by Richard Branson, Virgin Galactic aims to offer suborbital space tourism experiences using its SpaceShipTwo vehicles launched by White Knight II. While not focusing on large-scale scientific exploration like the others, it represents a key area of commercial space development.

5.  **China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) / CAST (China Academy of Space Technology):** While technically part of a state-owned structure, CAST is the primary space technology developer for China. Companies like CSCEC's aerospace division build and operate China's major space systems, including the Tiangong space station, the Long March rocket family, and the Chang'e lunar exploration program. (Note: This differs slightly from purely commercial private ventures but highlights the scale of national programs involved in exploration).

These companies, alongside government space agencies like NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, and CNSA, are driving much of the current and future space exploration activity.
